# Research → Design → Plan Prompt Kit

A tiny toolkit of three ChatGPT prompt templates that move a project from discovery to an executable slice plan.

## Templates
- **Step 1 · Research:** Generates a cited PRD with assumptions, risks, slices, data model, and stack ideas.
- **Step 2 · Design:** Converts the PRD into a technical design covering architecture, interfaces, tooling, and open questions.
- **Step 3 · Plan:** Builds a tests-first implementation roadmap with guardrails, quality expectations, and slice sequencing.

## Workflow
1. Run Step 1 with your project context and save the output.
2. Feed that result into Step 2 to produce the technical design.
3. Combine the Step 1 and 2 artifacts in Step 3 to create the build plan.
