# Step 1 — Research Prompt

## How to use

Fill the bracketed fields. Paste this into ChatGPT **with web browsing on** and attach any relevant docs or links. If facts are missing, leave them blank—the prompt instructs ChatGPT to state **Assumptions** and **Open Questions**. Save the output as **step-1-research-output.md**. Re‑run after answering open questions. The goal is to produce evidence and draft **acceptance criteria** for the initial scope.

You are my **product research analyst** and **technical due‑diligence partner**. Produce a concise, evidence‑based Product Requirements Document (PRD) that will feed **Step‑2 Design** and the subsequent planning cycle.

## Input (from me)

* **Project name:** {{Name}}
* **One-sentence objective:** {{Objective}}
* **Primary users & JTBD:** {{Users / key jobs}}
* **Core problem / use cases:** {{Problem / use cases}}
* **Constraints (must/should):** {{Platforms, data residency, security, budget/time}}
* **Known assets:** {{Existing data/APIs, repos, design, brand, domains}}
* **Environments:** {{Web/mobile/desktop/CLI; OS; cloud}}
* **Non-goals / out of scope:** {{Non-goals}}
* **Success criteria (business & user):** {{KPIs, UX outcomes}}
* **Depth:** {{brief | standard | deep}}  (default: standard)

## What to do

1. **Research & synthesize** with citations; date any time‑sensitive facts.
2. **Define the concept**: problem, users, constraints, and success criteria. 
3. **Assess feasibility**: identify critical data sources, platform constraints, and research-backed considerations without prescribing implementation.
4. **Expose gaps**: clearly label **Assumptions** and **Open Questions**.

## Output format (markdown)

### Bottom line

* One paragraph: what we should build **now** and why (evidence-based).

### Problem Statement

* What problem does this application solve and why is it valuable?

### Target Users / Personas

* Who will use the app?
* What are their top 3 jobs-to-be-done?

### Comparable solutions / references

* 3–5 relevant apps, patterns, or repos with 1-line takeaways.

### User Stories

* Up to three user stories in 'given/when/then' format. 

### Must-Have Features (MVP)

* Core functionality that must exist in version 1. 

### Nice-to-Have Features

* Optional enhancements that can wait. 

### Non-functional Requirements

* Outline non-functional requirements such as performance (e.g., load within 2 seconds), security (e.g., input validation, secrets handling), privacy (e.g., no sensitive data logged) or compatibility (e.g., Python 3.12, modern browsers).

### Data Considerations

* Key data sources, quality notes, and any structural implications worth highlighting for later design.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Checklist of measurable outcomes (e.g.' "User can add and view a task within 3 clicks").

### Risks & Mitigations

* Top 5 risks with a mitigation/fallback each. 

### Out-of-Scope

* Explicitly excluded features or platforms. 

### Assumptions

* Clearly labeled defaults used where information was missing.

### Open questions (answer before planning)

* Numbered list. Significant open questions only, leave blank when trivial questions remain. 

### Sources

* 5–8 reputable links with titles and **publication dates**.

## Guardrails

* Be concise. Bullets over prose. Avoid hype.
* Cite sources inline like \[1], and list full references in **Sources**.
* If evidence conflicts, show both views and recommend a bias.
* Do **not** propose solutions that violate constraints.
* If a key fact is missing, make one **Assumption** and flag it.
